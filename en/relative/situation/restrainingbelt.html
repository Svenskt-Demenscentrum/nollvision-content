  <h2>She needs a restraining belt</h2>
  
  <p>“My mother tries to get up from her wheelchair and has fallen a few times. I’m worried that she may break a leg. Why can’t she have a belt so that she doesn't fall?”</p>
<p>Naturally, both you and the staff want to protect and prevent accidents. But also safety precautions can be defined as restraint, if the person they concern does not give his consent.</p>
  <p>As a person with dementia can have difficulty giving his consent, it is better if the situation can be avoided. Being belted and not understanding why, can cause worry and anxiety.</p>
  <p>In the long run, it could cause both weakening of the muscles and impaired balance. You have important information and knowledge about the person suffering from dementia that the staff needs to know, in order to enable them to prevent accidents without using force.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>

<p>Talk to the staff about your concern. Why is mother so anxious? Is she bored? Can there be some physical problem?</p>
<p>Together perhaps you and the staff can come up with ideas to prevent accidents from happening, for example:</p>
<p>- keep them company and try to have a conversation</p>
  <p>- take walks</p>
  <p>- physical contact, like a gentle touch or light massage to help the person calm down</p>
  <p>- music</p>
  <p>- try activities like drying dishes, reading a newspaper or just holding a cushion.</p>
