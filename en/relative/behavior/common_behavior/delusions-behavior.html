<h2>Delusions</h2>
<p>Delusions are not unusual when you have dementia. Believing that people hide or steal things and put poison in the food are examples of delusion. A person with dementia can also believe that their partner has been unfaithful.</p>
  <p>This can be difficult to cope with. Even if you know that it’s not true, in your partner’s mind it is true. It is difficult to try and convince your partner with logical and rational explanations.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
<p>- See if it helps to say: “What’s disappeared? I’ll check that out.”  Or: “I’ve written that down and I’ll take care of it.” That way you’ve taken over the responsibility and things will perhaps calm down.</p>
  <p>- If they say that someone has taken their wallet perhaps you can look for it together. After a while you can distract them by talking about something else.</p>
  <p>- If the delusions are difficult to cope with, ask for help from a doctor for assessment and possible medication.</p>
