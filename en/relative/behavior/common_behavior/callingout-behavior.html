<h2>Calling out and shouting</h2>
<p>A person with dementia can sometimes shout out loud or scream. They may call for help or for their mother.</p>
<p>To hear someone shouting or screaming might feel unpleasant and frightening. It could be a way of saying that they feel abandoned, but it could also be a reflex reaction. The person who is ill is not always conscious of the fact that they are shouting or screaming.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  <p>- Ask a nurse or a doctor to examine them to see if the shouting is due to pain or something else unpleasant.</p>
  <p>- Reduce the number of impressions and stimuli. A damaged brain needs more rest than a healthy brain. Suggest a nap in the middle of the day.</p>
  <p>- Help them take part in activities according to their ability, like combing their hair, mixing or beating a cake.</p>
  <p>- Go for a walk or do something else that will distract them.</p>
  <p>- Listen to the person's favourite music, perhaps with headphones.</p>
  <p>- Be close by and have some sort of physical contact.</p>
  <p>- Fuss over them by for example rubbing in perfumed skin cream, fix their hair, cut their nails or do something else that they like.</p>
