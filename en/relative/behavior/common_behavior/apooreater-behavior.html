<h2>A poor eater</h2>

<p>The person with dementia might eat less than before. This might be because they forget to eat. It can also be because they no longer remember how to use a knife and fork, or that they don’t recognize the food. This is not unusual and could be a result of the disease.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  <p>- Make sure there is peace and quiet during meals. Turn off the TV, radio or other sources of sound.</p>
  <p>- Reduce impressions and stimuli. Only set the table with what is going to be used during the meal. Too many things on the table can cause confusion.</p>
  <p>- Serve food in an appetizing way. Use contrasting colours, for example a coloured plate if serving white fish. This will make it easier to see the food.</p>
  <p>- Avoid asking questions or talking too much, this will make it easier to concentrate on eating.</p>
  <p>- Offer a snack like a piece of fruit, biscuits, ice-cream or a sandwich several times a day.</p>
  <p>- Remember that it’s important with regular visits to the toilet.</p>
  <p>- If necessary, contact and visit a dentist. Pain from sores, fungal infections or a damaged tooth may be causing the problem.</p>
  <p>- Do the medicines need to be reviewed? Some medication can affect both taste and appetite. Contact the health centre and talk to a doctor about a drug review.</p>
