<h2>Walking around</h2>

<p>A person with dementia is often restless or anxious and can walk around back and forth, perhaps pulling at a door handle or picking up things in wardrobes and drawers.</p>
  <p>This may feel disturbing and strange to you, but it might have a meaning for the one who is ill. It could be a way of dealing with anxiety or just a way of using up excess energy. There is no need to be worried or to stop their behaviour if they donâ€™t seem worried or upset.</p>
  <h4>What shall I do?</h4>
  <p>If the situation becomes troublesome you can try to distract their attention with other activities:</p>
  <p>- Try doing everyday chores like vacuum cleaning, folding the laundry, washing the dishes, emptying the rubbish bin or anything the person is used to doing. The important thing to do is to capture their interest, not what the result of the activity is.</p>
  <p>- Look at photographs. To support the memory, write the names of those who are in the photo on the backside of the photo.</p>
<p>- Play their favourite music.</p>
  <p>- Give them some extra food and drink.</p>
  <p>- Being near to someone, physical contact or a warm wheat cushion on the stomach can be soothing.</p>
