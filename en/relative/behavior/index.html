  <h2>Behavioural changes</h2>

  <p>When a person has dementia it often results in changing behaviour. To see someone close to you change can be frustrating. The changes may appear suddenly and without any apparent reason. Some are anxious, angry or have difficulty sleeping. Perhaps they do not understand that they need help.</p>
 <p>Some behavioural changes might be an expression of another physical illness, pain, stress, lack of stimulation or unhappiness. Others can be caused by brain damage.</p>
  <p>Adapting your way of responding and communicating can make some situations easier to handle.</p>
