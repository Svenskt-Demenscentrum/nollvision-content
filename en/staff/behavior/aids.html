  <h2>Aid</h2>

  <p>When a person is afflicted by dementia, different types of aid can be useful and make it easier to carry out and take part in different activities as independently as possible.</p>
  <p>There are gadgets that can make communication, remembering and the ability to organize daily life easier, whilst others can support time orientation. It is important that a person with dementia early on in the disease is taught how the aids work, in order to be able to make use of them as long as possible.</p>
<p>- A digital watch or clock to show if it is day or night with symbols and text.</p>
  <p>- A whiteboard where the staff or family members can write what’s happening during the day.</p>
  <p>- A weekly timetable showing planned activities and other events.</p>
  <p>- A tablet can support the memory and stimulate activity.</p>
  <p>- A watch or clock with recorded messages, reminding when it is time for different things, for example “It’s time to take your medicine”.</p>
  <p>- A personal alarm and GPS alarm could be a safety measure which contributes to the person’s wellbeing and independence, like being outside/outdoors in a safe way. Remember that a person must give his consent to such an aid.</p>
  <p>- A mobile phone can be a support for the memory and give a feeling of security.</p>
<p>Do you use any aids to make it easier to communicate?</p>
