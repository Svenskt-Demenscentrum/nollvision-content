<h2>A poor eater</h2>

<p>David has a bad appetite. He doesnâ€™t seem to remember that he should eat or how to use fork and knife.</p>
 <p>This could be because he has a hard time interpreting impressions and recognising what is on the table, but also because it is difficult for him to in perceive different smells and flavours (agnosia).</p>
  <p>It might also be that he no longer remembers how to eat, even though he is physically capable of doing so (apraxia). Is the problem caused by dementia or by problems in the oral cavity?</p>
  <h4>Tips:</h4>
<p>- Examine the oral cavity. The problem may be caused by pain from a sore, a fungal infection or a damaged tooth.</p>
  <p>- Review the medications. Some of them might cause gastritis or constipation, and others may affect on both taste and appetite.</p>
  <p>- Create peace and quiet during mealtimes. Turn off the TV, radio and dish washer.</p>
  <p>- Reduce the number of stimuli during mealtimes. Serve only one course at a time. Too many things on the table can cause confusion.</p>
  <p>- Serve food in an appetising way. Use contrasting colours, for example a coloured plate if white fish is served. It will then be easier to see the food.</p>
  <p>- Sit and eat together. If the person sees how and what you do, it can be easier to do the same thing.</p>
  <p>- Avoid asking a lot of questions or talking too much, in order not to disturb concentration.</p>
  <p>- Offer texture-modified food and smaller snacks such as fruit, biscuits, smoothies, ice cream or a sandwich.</p>
  <p>What strategies do you have for helping a person to eat better?</p>
