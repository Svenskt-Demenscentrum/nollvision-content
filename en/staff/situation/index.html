  <h2>Behavioural changes</h2>

  <p>For people with dementia, anger, anxiety or sleeping disorders can suddenly emerge without any apparent reason. 
    These can be expressions for another illness, pain, stress, environmental factors, under stimulation or the brain damage itself.</p>
 <p>It is often difficult to treat the behavioural changes. 
    It is therefore a good thing to share experiences with colleagues, so that you can support each other at work.</p>
<p>The life history is a good starting point. Good contact with the family is important in order to prevent and treat behavioural changes. 
  Adapting your approach and the way you communicate will make some situations easier to handle.</p>
